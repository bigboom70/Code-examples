/*the question
How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

solutions given (not looked at before making this code or writing this. So it may be obvious not sure)

#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

int main()
{
	int list[101] = { 0 };

	srand((int)time(0));
	int random = (rand() % 100) + 1;

	//generates list of numbers 0 - 100
	for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
		list[i] = i;
	}
	
	//generates random errors in list
	for (int i = 0; i <= random; i++) {
		random = (rand() % 100) + 1;
		list[random] = (rand() % 100) + 1;
	}

	//solution to finding said errors and pointing them out
	int expected = 0;
	int current = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
		expected += i;
		current += list[i];
		if (current != expected) {
			current = expected;
			std::cout << "the number at array section: " << i << " does not equal: ";
			std::cout << i << "\ninstead it equals: " << list[i];
			//could be list[i] instead of all the math but thats no fun
			std::cout << '\n';
	
		}
		
	}
	
}
